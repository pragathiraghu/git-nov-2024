Git squash is a method of condensing multiple commits into a single commit, often used to simplify and clean up the commit history before merging a branch into the main branch. It is typically done during an interactive rebase.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

Why Use Git Squash?
Clean Commit History: Combine small, related changes into one meaningful commit.
Avoid Clutter: Prevent numerous minor commits from appearing in the main branch.
Improve Code Review: Make it easier for reviewers to understand the changes.

Steps to Squash Commits
Start Interactive Rebase:

bash
Copy code
git rebase -i HEAD~N
Replace N with the number of commits you want to squash (e.g., HEAD~3 for the last 3 commits).

Mark Commits for Squashing:

In the text editor that opens, you'll see a list of commits, each labeled with pick:
sql
Copy code
pick abc123 Commit message 1
pick def456 Commit message 2
pick ghi789 Commit message 3
Change all but the first pick to squash (or s):
sql
Copy code
pick abc123 Commit message 1
squash def456 Commit message 2
squash ghi789 Commit message 3
Edit Commit Message:

After saving the changes, Git will prompt you to edit the commit message. Combine or modify the messages as needed to describe the squashed commit clearly.
Complete the Rebase:

Save and exit the editor. Git will squash the commits and rewrite the history.
Push the Changes (if needed):

If you've already pushed the commits to a remote branch, you'll need to force-push the changes:
bash
Copy code
git push origin branch-name --force
Practical Use Case
Imagine you're working on a feature branch and have made multiple commits:

fix typo in function name
update README
add new feature
Before merging into the main branch, you can squash these into a single commit like:

add new feature with README update and typo fix
