When people refer to "git pop", they’re usually shorthand for the git stash pop command, which is part of the Git stash functionality. Here's a clearer breakdown:

What Does git stash pop Do?

defination*******************git stash pop restores (or "pops") the changes you previously saved using git stash back into your working directory***********************
It’s called "pop" because it removes the changes from the stash and applies them to your current working directory.

Example Scenario:
You're working on a project, but you’re not ready to commit your changes.

You stash your changes to temporarily save them:
git stash

Later, you come back to the same branch and want to bring those stashed changes back, so you run:


git stash pop
This restores your changes and removes them from the stash.
If you have multiple stashes, git stash pop will bring back the most recent one.

Summary of Key Commands:
git stash: Saves your current changes temporarily (like putting them in a "drawer").
git stash pop: Brings back (or pops) the changes from your "drawer" and applies them to your working directory.
git stash apply: Similar to git stash pop, but it doesn't remove the changes from the stash. You can reuse the stash later if needed.
