git commit command is used to save your changes to the local repository. It's like creating a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
Commit Changes: After staging, commit your changes with a meaningful message:
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Commit with Detailed Message (Optional): If you want to write a more detailed message, you can leave out the -m flag, and Git will open a text editor:
git commit
Amend a Commit (Optional): If you want to edit your last commit
git commit --amend
