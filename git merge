git merge is a critical command I use to integrate changes from one branch into another, 
ensuring seamless collaboration and version control. This command is central to managing branching strategies

****branching stratergies*****
"Branching strategies refer to structured workflows for managing code changes in a version control system 
 efficiently, maintain code quality, and support deployment processes.

In DevOps workflows, I often use git merge in automation contexts like CI/CD pipelines or infrastructure repositories 
to combine feature branches or hotfixes into the main branch. 
I also emphasize following branching and merging strategies, ensuring code stability and simplifying rollback processes.

********Hot Fix******

"A hotfix is an urgent, high-priority update that addresses critical issues in production, such as:**

Bugs causing downtime.
Security vulnerabilities.
Broken functionalities that impact users.

Steps in a hotfix process:

Create a dedicated branch from the main branch (hotfix/<issue-name>).
Apply and test the fix in isolation to minimize risks.
Merge the hotfix branch back into both main and develop (or other integration branches) to ensure future releases include the fix.
Deploy the fix to production immediately, often bypassing standard release schedules.
