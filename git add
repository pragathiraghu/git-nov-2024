git add is a Git command used to add changes in your working directory to the staging area. These changes could include newly created files, modified files, or deleted files. Once the changes are staged, they are ready to be committed to the repository.

Usage
Basic syntax:

bash
Copy code
git add <file>
This stages a specific file.

Add multiple files:

bash
Copy code
git add <file1> <file2>
Stages multiple files.

Stage all changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Stages all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Examples
Add a single file:

bash
Copy code
git add index.html
Add all files in the current directory:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Add a specific type of file (e.g., .txt files):

bash
Copy code
git add *.txt
