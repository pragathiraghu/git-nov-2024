"Git fetch is fundamentally about getting updates from a remote repository without integrating those changes into your working file

Let me break it down in the simplest way possible:
Think of git fetch like checking your mail:

 Checking your mailbox
  git fetch origin

# This tells you what new mail arrived
     git log main..origin/main

Real-world example:
You're working on your laptop
Your teammate pushed some changes to GitHub
You want to see those changes but aren't ready to merge them yet

Step 1: Download the latest changes from GitHub (just downloading, not applying)
git fetch origin

# Step 2: Now you can safely look at what's new
git log main..origin/main

# Step 3: If you like the changes, then you can merge them
git merge origin/main

**********Key point:*********
git fetch = Just checking what's new (safe, can't break anything)
git pull = Checking AND applying changes immediately (fetch + merge)

It's like:
fetch = Looking at the menu
pull = Ordering and eating the food immediately
