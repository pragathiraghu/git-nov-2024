In Git, "cherry-pick" refers to selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them to another branch. It's like picking individual items from a list rather than taking everything.

For example, if you have a branch with many commits, but you only want to apply one or two of them to another branch, you can use git cherry-pick. This allows you to bring over just those changes, instead of merging the entire branch.

  Example:
You have two branches: main and feature.
  
The feature branch has 5 commits, but you only want to apply commit #3 to the main branch.
  
You would do:
Checkout the main branch: git checkout main

Cherry-pick the specific commit from feature: git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-#3> (commit id)
  
This way, only the changes from that specific commit are added to the main branch, leaving the rest behind.
