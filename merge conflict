What is a Merge Conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two or more developers make changes to the same part of a file, and version control systems (like Git) canâ€™t figure out how to automatically combine those changes.

Simple Explanation:
Imagine you're working on a project with a team. You and a teammate both edit the same line of code or part of a file, and then you both try to merge your changes into the main project. Since Git doesn't know which change should be kept, it flags a conflict and asks you to manually resolve it.

Your Change: You change a line in a file like this:
print("Hello from Developer A")

Teammate's Change: Your teammate changes the same line to:
print("Hello from Developer B")

Now, when you try to combine both changes, Git doesn't know which line to keep, so it results in a merge conflict.

How to Resolve it:
To resolve this, as a DevOps engineer, you'd need to:

Check the conflict: Git will mark the conflict in the file, showing both changes with special markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
Decide what to keep: You manually choose which changes to keep. This could be one version, a combination of both, or even a completely different solution.
Commit the resolved file: Once the conflict is resolved, you commit the changes and the merge process continues.

How to prevent it? Frequent commits, good branching practices, automated testing, and continuous integration pipelines help reduce merge conflicts
