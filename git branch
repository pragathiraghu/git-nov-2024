git branch command is used to manage branches in a Git repository. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its usage:

Viewing Branches

git branch
This lists all the branches in your repository. The currently active branch is marked with an asterisk (*) and highlighted.

Creating a New Branch

git branch <branch_name>
This creates a new branch called <branch_name> without switching to it.

Switching to a Branch

git checkout <branch_name>
or, in newer Git versions:


git switch <branch_name>
Creating and Switching to a Branch

git checkout -b <branch_name>
or:
git switch -c <branch_name>

Renaming a Branch
git branch -m <new_name>

If you're on the branch you want to rename, omit the branch name:
git branch -m

Deleting a Branch

Delete a local branch:
git branch -d <branch_name>

Use -D to force deletion if the branch is not fully merged:
git branch -D <branch_name>

Delete a remote branch:
git push origin --delete <branch_name>

Comparing Branches
To compare two branches:
git diff <branch1>..<branch2>

Listing Remote Branches
git branch -r

Listing All Branches (Local and Remote)
git branch -a
