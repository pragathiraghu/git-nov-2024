*********************************git log**********************************
git log shows you the history of commits in your Git repository. It gives a list of all commits made in the current branch (or any branch you specify). This includes details like:

The commit hash (a unique identifier for each commit)
The author of the commit
The commit date and time
The commit message

You can add options to customize the output, like git log --oneline for a shorter version of the log with just the commit hash and message.
*******************************git status***************************************
git status
git status shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It tells you:

Which files have been modified
Which files are staged (ready to be committed)
Which files are untracked (not added to Git yet)
It helps you keep track of your changes and see what needs to be committed or pushed.

In short:

git log shows commit history.
git status shows the current state of your project, including what changes are made and what needs to be done.
