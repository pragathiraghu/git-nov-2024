In simplest terms, a git tag is like a bookmark in a Git repository that points to a specific commit. It is typically used to mark important points in a project's history, like a release or a version. For example, when you reach a stable version of your code, you can create a tag (like "v1.0") to easily reference that point later.

Unlike branches, which are meant to be worked on, tags are usually meant to stay fixed and are not updated.

A git tag is a lightweight reference to a specific commit in your Git repository, typically used to mark a release or milestone, like v1.0.0 or release-2024. Tags are static — once they're created, they don’t change, unlike branches. This makes them ideal for denoting stable points in your project history, such as versions or deployment candidates.

Tags come in two types:

Lightweight tags: Simple pointers to a commit, like a branch, but they don’t contain any metadata.
Annotated tags: These store extra metadata (like the tagger’s name, date, and a message), making them more suitable for version releases.
In DevOps, tags are crucial for:

Versioning: Using tags in your CI/CD pipeline ensures that deployments can be traced back to a specific commit.
Automation: Tags can trigger automatic deployment to environments, for example, deploying only when a new tag is pushed, signifying a stable version ready for release.
You might also use tags to trigger actions in tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions, ensuring your automation pipeline aligns with the tagged version.
