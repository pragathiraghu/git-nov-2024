When answering as a DevOps engineer with 5 years of experience, focus on the practical applications of GitHub and GitHub Actions in the context of DevOps workflows. Here’s how you can respond:

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a version control platform built on Git that enables teams to collaborate on software development projects. As a DevOps engineer, I rely on GitHub for:

Code Collaboration and Management: It’s where the entire team works on shared repositories, using branching strategies (like GitFlow) to manage development, testing, and release cycles.
Version Control: GitHub ensures that all changes to the codebase are tracked, enabling rollbacks, comparisons, and collaboration without conflicts.
Integration with DevOps Toolchains: It seamlessly integrates with CI/CD pipelines, container registries, monitoring systems, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
Code Reviews and Quality: Pull requests and code reviews allow us to ensure high-quality code before merging into the main branch.
In essence, GitHub is the foundation for version control and team collaboration, making it critical to a DevOps pipeline.

As a DevOps engineer working with GitHub Actions, your daily tasks typically revolve around automating workflows, improving CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring the reliability of deployments.
